# BigBang phase

Here, we will describe all feature of the first phase. This phase is associated with the milestone `BigBang (0)`.

## Documentation

We provide a complete documentation of what we need to implement and the purpose of all milestone.
Moreover, we implement a code of conducts, named `CONTRIBUTING.md`, to explain how participate on the project.

Firstly, we are interested on the main purpose of `eos` : to provide an automonomous header manager on all programer's files (the first four milestones).
After this basic's implementation, we will provide some other tools.

## Skeleton

It is the corpus of the project.

### Test

Set up of an entire testing system with `OUnit`. We locate it in a test folder.

For each feature, we provide some test to be ensure the right behavior.

### Compilation and execution

We set up an entire system for compiling and testing functionality.

To do this, we establish a Travis on the github project.

Moreover, to test the program on localhost, a docker is installed.
